# Summary

This repo includes some statistic test functions's javascript implementation.

- Levene Test
- Welch Test
- Games-Howell post hoc test

Additionally, an javascript as well as Python implementation of compact letter display, which is very commonly used for pairwise comparisons in statictics. There is an R package (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/multcompView/versions/0.1-8/topics/multcompLetters) for this but nothing in Python or JS.

# Author's plan

I had a hard time to find something similar online, I wrote those functions to share.
The JS implementation uses jstat package, so maybe in the future, I will contribute to add those functions into that project.
